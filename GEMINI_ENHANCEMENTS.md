# Gemini AI Integration Enhancements

## Overview
The mental health app has been successfully enhanced to use Google's Gemini AI API instead of training custom models. This provides more sophisticated, context-aware mental health support with advanced natural language processing capabilities.

## Key Enhancements

### 1. Enhanced Chatbot (`gemini_chatbot.py`)
- **Comprehensive Mental Health Context**: Detailed system prompts covering various mental health conditions, therapeutic approaches, and crisis recognition
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Chatbot now considers user's current mood, conversation history, and emotional state
- **Crisis Detection Integration**: Automatic identification of crisis situations with appropriate resource provision
- **Personalized Coping Strategies**: AI-generated, emotion-specific coping techniques
- **Enhanced Emergency Support**: Comprehensive crisis resources with multiple support options

### 2. Advanced Mood Detection (`gemini_mood_detector.py`)
- **Expanded Emotion Mapping**: 50+ emotions with precise scoring (1-10 scale)
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Includes emotional context, crisis indicators, and secondary emotions
- **Crisis Detection**: Advanced keyword and pattern recognition for crisis situations
- **Trend Analysis**: User mood tracking with statistical analysis and trend detection
- **Deviation Detection**: Identifies significant mood changes that may require attention

### 3. Enhanced API Endpoints (`app.py`)
- **Context-Aware Chat**: `/chat` endpoint now passes mood context to chatbot
- **Crisis Detection**: `/crisis-check` endpoint for real-time crisis assessment
- **Coping Strategies**: `/coping-strategies` endpoint for personalized support
- **Enhanced Emergency Support**: Comprehensive crisis resources and intervention

### 4. Updated Dependencies
- **Latest Gemini API**: Updated to `google-generativeai==0.8.3`
- **Environment Configuration**: Proper setup for Gemini API key
- **Test Script**: `test_gemini.py` for verifying integration

## New Features

### Mental Health Context
- Understanding of anxiety, depression, stress, trauma, and mood disorders
- Knowledge of CBT, DBT, mindfulness, and grounding techniques
- Crisis recognition and appropriate escalation
- Evidence-based coping strategies

### Emotion Analysis

- **Neutral Emotions**: calm, relaxed, balanced, curious, interested, focused, contemplative, reflective
- **Negative Emotions**: sadness, grief, depression, anxiety, worry, fear, anger, frustration, stress, loneliness, shame, guilt, confusion, disappointment, exhaustion

### Crisis Detection
- **Severe Indicators**: suicide, self-harm, severe depression
- **Moderate Indicators**: hopelessness, worthlessness, giving up
- **Automatic Escalation**: Immediate crisis resources when needed

### Context Awareness
- **Mood Integration**: Chatbot responses consider current emotional state
- **Conversation History**: Maintains context across multiple interactions
- **Personalized Support**: Tailored responses based on user's emotional patterns
